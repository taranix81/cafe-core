The `CafeApplicationContext` class is part of the IOC (Inversion of Control) framework that facilitates managing beans, annotations, and resolving dependencies within the `cafe-core` project.

### Key Features:
1. **Core Components:**
    - `MultiRepository<TypeKey, BeanRepositoryEntry>`: Stores bean definitions and their metadata.
    - `CafeClassDescriptors`: Describes class-level metadata (e.g., annotations).
    - `CafeBeansFactory`: Responsible for creating and managing beans.
    - `CafeResolvers`: Resolves various dependencies like fields, methods, constructors, etc.

2. **Initialization:**
    - The `initialize()` method resolves all beans during the application setup.
    - `CafePropertiesContext.load()` loads properties into the repository using a provided `ClassLoader`.

3. **Bean Management:**
    - `getInstance(Class<T>)`: Returns an instance of a bean, supporting both Singleton and Prototype scopes.
    - `getInstances(Class<T>, String identifier)`: Retrieves beans of a specific type and identifier.
    - `refresh(Object object)`: Updates beans and resolves their fields if marked as Singleton.

4. **Annotations and Class Descriptors:**
    - `getAnnotations()`: Fetches all annotations used in the application.
    - `getClassDescriptor(Class<?>)`: Retrieves metadata for a specific class.

5. **Builder Pattern:**
    - The `BeansContextBuilder` class provides a configurable way to set up the `CafeApplicationContext`. It supports:
        - Package scanning.
        - Adding resolvers for classes, constructors, methods, and fields.
        - Specifying annotations, repository, classes, and class loader.

6. **Error Handling:**
    - Throws `CafeApplicationContextException` when necessary (e.g., missing annotations, no instances found).

### Purpose:
This class forms the backbone of the IOC framework in `cafe-core`, enabling dynamic and configurable bean resolution and dependency injection for applications built on this framework.
