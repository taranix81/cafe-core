The `CafeApplication` class serves as an abstract base class for defining and managing an application's context within the IOC (Inversion of Control) framework. It facilitates the initialization, configuration, and execution of an application using annotated classes, repositories, and resolvers. Here's a summary of its components:

### Key Features
1. **Initialization**:
    - Validates the application's configuration class to ensure it has the required `@CafeApplication` annotation.
    - Creates a `CafeApplicationContext` with annotations, class resolvers, method resolvers, and package scans.

2. **Lifecycle Hooks**:
    - `beforeContextInit`: A placeholder method for actions before context initialization (empty by default).
    - `postContextInit`: Refreshes the application context after initialization.

3. **Bean and Repository Management**:
    - Provides methods to add beans and repositories to the application context (`addBeanToContext` and `addRepositoryToContext`).

4. **Annotation and Resolver Customization**:
    - Allows customization of annotations, class resolvers, method resolvers, and scanned packages through protected methods.

5. **Execution**:
    - Defines an abstract method `execute` for running the application with arguments (`run` method).

6. **Instance Retrieval**:
    - Offers methods to retrieve instances of classes or beans from the application context, optionally using identifiers.

7. **Application Context Access**:
    - Provides access to the `CafeBeansFactory` for managing beans.

### Key Methods
- **Constructor**:
    - Initializes the application context and validates the configuration class.
- **Annotation Handling**:
    - `defaultAnnotations` and `getCustomAnnotations` handle built-in and custom annotations.
- **Package Scanning**:
    - Dynamically determines packages to scan based on configuration and extending class details.
- **Execution**:
    - The `run` method delegates to the abstract `execute` method, requiring implementation in subclasses.

This class is designed to be extended by specific application implementations, providing the flexibility to define custom behavior while adhering to a structured lifecycle and configuration.
