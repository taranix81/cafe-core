The `CafePropertiesContext` class is part of the `org.taranix.cafe.beans` package, and it serves as a context for loading and managing application properties. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### Key Features:
1. **Constants for Property Files**:
    - Defines constants for base and test property filenames (`application` and `application-test`) with extensions for `.properties`, `.yaml`, and `.yml`.

2. **Initialization**:
    - The class requires a `Repository` and `ClassLoader` for initialization.
    - Properties are loaded from both the classpath and the working directory, and then stored in the repository.

3. **Loading Properties**:
    - Supports loading `.properties`, `.yaml`, and `.yml` files.
    - It flattens nested configurations in YAML files into a single `Properties` object.

4. **Repository Integration**:
    - Populates a repository with the loaded properties using `PropertyTypeKey` and `BeanRepositoryEntry`.

5. **Utility Methods**:
    - `loadProperties`: Loads `.properties` files.
    - `loadYaml`: Loads and converts YAML files to `Properties`.
    - `flatten`: Flattens nested YAML structures into key-value pairs.
    - `getInputStreamFromClassLoader`: Retrieves files from the classpath.
    - `getInputStreamFromPath`: Retrieves files from the working directory.
    - `getCurrentPath`: Returns the absolute path of the current working directory.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - Throws `CafePropertiesContextException` for file access or parsing errors.

### Usage:
- The class can be instantiated via the static `load` method, which creates a new context, loads properties, and integrates them into the given repository.
- This design is ideal for managing configuration settings in an IOC framework.
